# 🌱 Sustainable Web Optimization Plugin

**Sustainable Web Optimization Plugin** is a demo tool designed to help web hosting platforms verify and incentivize eco-friendly website optimizations. Using **smart contract-like validation**, the plugin verifies whether a website has met specific sustainability goals (like converting images to WebP, minifying CSS/JS, or enabling lazy loading) and automatically applies hosting fee discounts based on successful improvements.

## 🚀 Features
- **Smart Contract Simulation**: Tasks such as image conversion, CSS/JS minification, and lazy loading are subject to verification before savings are applied.
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Hosting fee discounts are applied based on the verified optimizations, ensuring fairness and real sustainability impact.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Provides visual feedback to the user once optimizations are verified or rejected, with potential savings displayed.
- **Eco-Friendly Incentive**: Encourages businesses to adopt sustainable web practices by offering reduced hosting costs when KPIs are met.

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TKS-Gabriel/sustainabilitygpt.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd sustainabilitygpt
   ```

3. **Open `index.html` in your browser**:
   You can open the `index.html` file directly in any modern browser to test the demo.

## 💻 Usage

1. **Launch the Plugin**:
   - Open the demo by clicking the floating 🌱 button.
   
2. **Verify Optimizations**:
   - Manually click on the “Verify” buttons next to each suggested optimization (e.g., **Convert Images to WebP**, **Minify CSS/JS**).
   - The system simulates smart contract verification with a short delay.
   - Upon successful verification, the task will turn green and the corresponding savings will be applied.
   - If the task fails verification (e.g., **Lazy Loading**), the savings will not be applied, and a failure message will display.

3. **Check the Total Savings**:
   - The new monthly price will be displayed at the top, based on the successfully verified optimizations.

## 📋 How It Works

The plugin demonstrates how web hosting platforms like **Wix** or **GoDaddy** can integrate a tool that encourages businesses to adopt eco-friendly practices. The process follows these steps:
1. Users are prompted with suggested optimizations.
2. The plugin verifies the success of each optimization using a smart contract simulation.
3. Hosting fee discounts are applied based on successful verifications, offering businesses an incentive to optimize their websites for sustainability.
