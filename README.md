# 🌱 SustainabilityGPT - Sustainable Web Optimization Plugin

**SustainabilityGPT** is a demo tool designed to help web hosting platforms automatically verify and incentivize eco-friendly website optimizations. By using smart contract-like validation, the plugin verifies whether a website has met specific sustainability KPIs (like converting images to WebP, minifying CSS/JS, or enabling lazy loading) and applies hosting fee discounts based on successful improvements, driving businesses towards sustainable web practices.

## 🚀 Features
- **Smart Contract Simulation**: Verifies sustainability optimizations such as image conversion, file minification, and lazy loading before discounts are applied.
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Hosting fees are reduced based on successfully verified optimizations, ensuring only genuine improvements result in savings.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Visual indicators show which optimizations have been verified and the resulting savings.
- **Sustainability Incentive**: Provides a tangible reward for websites that meet eco-friendly KPIs by reducing hosting fees based on performance improvements.

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TKS-Gabriel/sustainabilitygpt.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd sustainabilitygpt
   ```

3. **Open `index.html` in your browser**:
   You can directly open the `index.html` file in any modern browser to explore the demo.

## 💻 Usage

1. **Launch the Plugin**:
   - Open the demo by clicking the floating 🌱 button.
   
2. **Verify Optimizations**:
   - Click on the “Verify” buttons next to each suggested optimization (e.g., **Convert Images to WebP**, **Minify CSS/JS**).
   - The system simulates smart contract verification with a short delay.
   - Upon successful verification, the task will turn green and the corresponding savings will be applied.
   - If the task fails verification (e.g., **Lazy Loading**), the savings will not be applied, and a failure message will display.

3. **Check the Total Savings**:
   - The new monthly hosting price will adjust based on the verified optimizations.

## 📋 How It Works

The **SustainabilityGPT** plugin encourages sustainable web practices by offering dynamic hosting discounts when specific environmental KPIs are met. This demo shows how it works:
1. Users receive suggestions for optimizing their websites.
2. A simulated smart contract verifies whether these optimizations have been successfully implemented.
3. Hosting fee discounts are dynamically applied based on successful verification, giving businesses financial motivation to go green.
